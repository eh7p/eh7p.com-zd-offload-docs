# Zendesk Sidebar App Setup

The [sidebar app]({% link docs/sidebar-app.md %}) provides an interface within the Zendesk app to retain access to offloaded attachments.

Navigate to the [Sidebar App page on the Zendesk Marketplace](https://www.zendesk.com/in/marketplace/apps/support/1002546/attachment-storage-offload/){:target="_blank"} and install the application

This API Token ensures that communication between the Zendesk app and our servers is secured.

The app is now setup to access offloaded attachments
