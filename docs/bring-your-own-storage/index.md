# Bring Your Own Storage

If you would like to bring your own storage solution, the Hybrid solution is for you. For this solution, we manage all the extracting and offloading of attachments, into your own storage provider. No attachments are stored on our servers and are only used for managing the solution and transmitting attachments between Zendesk and your storage solution.

We can also provide fully [on-premises solutions]({% link docs/on-premises.md %}) if required.

We can support almost any cloud storage solution including:
- AWS S3
- Azure Storage Containers
- Google Cloud Storage
- Digital Ocean Spaces
- Cloudflare R2 Storage

Please get in touch if you require an alternate provider and we can look into adding support for you.

Check out our guides below for end-to-end guides for how to setup for Hybrid storage.
